# ReadMe Generator  

## Description  
The motivation for this project was very clear - ReadMe's can be a pain! As a future developer who is making projects quite often, getting to the end of a project you worked very hard on and then having to create the readme for it can be frustrating. Your brain is already fried, and you end up staring at the screen for a long while before you figure out how they're structured again. The ReadMe Generator makes it painlesss!  
While working on this project, I learned a lot about inquirer and how useful it can be. I also got more comfortable with arrow functions and coding in different files, then bringing them together and creating something out of it!  

## Installation  
Inquirer is required for this project. It's very simple, you just type this into the terminal:  
npm i inquirer@8.2.4.  
For the project to work properly you need the packages from inquirer and then the index.js, generateMarkdown.js, and the .gitignore files. 

## Usage  
This application is so useful for anyone who is producing any kind of coding project, because any quality coding project must include a readme.
